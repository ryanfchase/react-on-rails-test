# While on the topic of origins, by default Rails 5 now checks a requestâ€™s Origin header as 
#   an additional defense against CSRF attacks. Since our web app origin will always be 
#   different than the API origin, the check will fail. To disable the check, I added the 
#   following line to cors.rb:
# Rails.application.config.action_controller.forgery_protection_origin_check = false
